My name is Amanda Woehl and this is my study case

The following link contains the project chosen:

In order to give a context, the project was made for a client that was building a 
delivery app. They already had a plataform that helped restaurants to create a ewebsite 
that could be used as a delivery platform. The client wanted to use those retaurants to 
start a delivery app and also include more clients in their system and hadn’t build a new 
page for every new client.

•	What was the problem? 
In small cities in south of Brazil, many restaurants and small businesses had the challenge 
to adapt to new ways to sell their products. The restaurants owners and small foodtrucks owners 
complained about the high percentage that platforms like Uber Eats, Ifood, etc charge. Due to the 
high demand in big cities this is not a problem but, for a small business in a small town 20% of 
its profit could make the difference.
In order to offer a different and more complete service the delivery would include other business 
such as: gas and water delivery, grocery stores and pharmacies. This would be a differential due 
to the existence of a bigger rural area where people aren’t able to go to bigger centers so frequently. 

•	What research did you conduct?
The first step was identified which and how much users where involved in the use of this app. Then the 
next step was to create a briefing that helped measure how much the client knew about all the different 
types of users and what would be the requirements for the project. When the briefing was delivered, 
we could discuss the weakness and strengths of the projects. 
The next step was to discover how the workflow in a restaurant worked and the points that causes problems were. 
So, all the information in the briefing was validated in interviews with business owners and workers.
At the same time, it was crucial to understand how the competitors worked. So, a study with the competitors was made, 
we analyze step by step what worked and what causes problems in their platform. 

•	How did you make decisions?
The primal goal was to make an interface easy to use. So, every decision was made in order to simplify the action the 
user would have to make. It was made a guide of what characteristics the layout had to have, could have and hadn't. 
So, every detail created was verify if matches those criteria. 

•	Did you use a styleguide? If so, who created it?
The styleguide was made based in a benchmark research, after that a semantic panel was made and that dictated the visual style. 
It has to be familiar for the user and stand out from the competition, since the app was new in the market it had to give 
confidence to the public.

•	How did you solve that problem?
Using the information, the client had about users and had this information checked with thee user. A profile of the user was 
created so we could find a concept easily. The benchmark research helped to validate the problematic points sellers and buyers 
showed in the briefing.
The solution was bringing elements and actions that were common in users’ life. The product became a card where in this card it 
was able to find the information of the product, like a game card. This helped who add the product to understand what information 
the product has to show to the costumer. For the costumer this helped in the checkout, because it worked like a card deck.
This concept came because it is a very strong culture to target customers to play with cards. So, this gamification gave the 
simplicity we were looking for.

•	How did you collaborate with teammates (PMs, engineers, stakeholders, designers)?
My job was to guide the developers in the user needs, I was responsible to make sure that the features make sense to the costumer. 
It was also my job to create the visual identity based on a usability that worked smooth and easy to the user. 
Since was a remote project, I also managed what information was necessary to the project goes on, helping the develop team and the 
client to focus in the user’s needs.  

•	How did you measure its success?
The app wasn't launched yet, but it would be easily measure by the traffic of users and sells made inside the platform. 
In a med-term, the number of business entering in the app and in the long-term the consistence of business and sells that continue 
happen in the platform. Also, the number of business in different cities entering in the platform.

•	What do you know now that you wish you knew when you started? How the project would change?
The user research was focused in the business owner and the client, the person that delivers the product was identified in the beginning 
of the research but was not developed a study for this user. I wish I had the experience in research I had now to include this user in the 
same level of importance that the business owner and the client.
